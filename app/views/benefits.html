    <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">What you get from being part of the Identity and Attributes Exchange</h1>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Save time, effort and money</h2>

      <p>You'll get a trust mark when you become a trusted provider in the IAX scheme. This proves you follow government and industry guidance on how to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>stop criminals or users that are pretending to be someone else</li>
        <li>run a secure product or service</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The trust mark will also prove your product or service can be used safely.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Show other schemes you meet their standards</h2>

      <p>Organisations that are part of schemes in other industries (such as finance, health and retail) might be certified against equivalent standards.</p>
      <p>Being certified to join the IAX could reduce the time and effort you spend on getting certified to join other schemes. In some cases it can even mean you will not need to go through another full certification process.</p>
      <p>Preparing to be certified takes time and can cost some organisations up to £45,000 each time.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Security built in</h2>

      <p>Being part of the IAX means everybody will have to meet the same technical specifications.</p>
      <p>Being part of the IAX means everybody will have to meet a level of security controls appropriate to the technology they use.</p>
      <p>That means you can trust that everyone involved is meeting the same levels of security, which could mean fewer system breaches.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Building trust</h2>

      <p>If you’re part of the trust framework, the rest of the public sector and the private sector know what standards you meet and that you can be trusted.</p>
      <p>This creates a chain of trust and puts the public sector at the forefront of creating the standards for digital identity.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Make it easier for users to do things online</h2>

      <p>You'll know exactly how other organisations on the IAX scheme have created their digital identities or attributes because you’ll meet the same standards. You can trust that any information you get from other participants is accurate and reliable.</p>
      <p>Sharing identities and attributes will ultimately make it easier for users to do things online. This is because they'll no longer need to prove their identity and eligibility every time they interact with the government.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Sell products and services to the UK government</h2>

        <p>The IAX is currently the only digital identity scheme that lets you sell your products and services to the UK government.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Become a trusted provider</h2>

   <p>There are several roles in the IAX. You can be:</p>
     <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
       <li>an identity provider</li>
       <li>an attribute provider</li>
       <li>a broker</li>
     </ul>

   <p>Find out more about the different <a href="/roles">roles in the scheme</a>.</p>
   <p>You must be certified by an independent auditor before you can join the scheme. The auditor will make sure the products or services you supply meet the IAX's standards.</p>
