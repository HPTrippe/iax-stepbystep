        How Certification Works
      </h1>

      <p>
        Anybody that wants to join the Identity and Attributes Exchange (IAX) as an identity or attribute provider or attribute consumer must be certified. An independent auditor manages the certification process.
        </p>

      <p>As part of certification, you will need one of the following:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>a remote audit
        </li>
        <li>a remote audit plus an on-site audit
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>This depends on the role you want to play on the IAX and your risk level. Based on the evidence you provide, an auditor will let you know what’s right for you.

      <p>If you want to know more about the IAX, find out about the <a href="/benefits">benefits of joining</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Check if you can join the IAX</h2>

        <p>Answer 9 questions about your organisation to see if you’re eligible to join the IAX.</p>

        <p>If you meet the criteria you can apply to join the IAX and get certified. Your auditor will ask to see evidence of your answers as part of the certification process.</p>
